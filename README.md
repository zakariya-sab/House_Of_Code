# House of Code Solutions - Phase 1

This repository contains my solutions for the **House of Code** competition - **Phase 1**. The competition focuses on **string manipulation** in the **C programming language**. The goal of this phase was to solve a series of problems related to strings and basic algorithms, while adhering to strict rules such as not using built-in functions for certain tasks.

## Problems Solved

### 1. **Problem 1: Counting Runes (Create Your Own strlen())**
- **Description**: Implement a function to count the number of characters in a string without using the built-in `strlen()` function.
- **Code**: [solution.c](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem1/CountingRunes.c)
- **Executable**: [a.exe](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem1/a.exe)

### 2. **Problem 2: The Lost Scrolls of Algoria (Reverse a String)**
- **Description**: Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in string reversal functions.
- **Code**: [solution.c](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem2/The_Lost_Scrolls_Of_Algoria.c)
- **Executable**: [a.exe](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem2/a.exe)

### 3. **Problem 3: The Whisper of the Ancients (Reverse Words in a String)**
- **Description**: Implement a function to reverse the order of words in a given string.
- **Code**: [solution.c](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem3/The_Whisper_of_the_Ancients.c)
- **Executable**: [a.exe](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem3/a.exe)

### 4. **Problem 4: Guardian of the Ancient Scrolls (Valid Parentheses Check)**
- **Description**: Write a function to check if the brackets in a string are balanced and properly nested.
- **Code**: [solution.c](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem4/solution.c)
- **Executable**: [a.exe](./House_Of_Code_phase01/Problem4/a.exe)
